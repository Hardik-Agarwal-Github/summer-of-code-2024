# Hardik's Writeup For The Week 1 Project

The IEEE dataset was chosen for this project. The vast number of features were reduced and then one hot encoded.

Then SMOTE was applied as an oversampling technique to address data imbalance.

XGBOOST algorithm was used to make the model.

SHAP analysis was done in the end.
